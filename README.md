# GHS JLT Website
This project contains the source *code* for the JLT website Developed by HitikG and Ramit110.

It is currently being constructed and will be maintained by anyone who wishes to contribute.
For those wondering we are using a dummy database hosted on the HRiServer - 'The Crashed' - at the moment but we intend to use LocalDB in the final product.
