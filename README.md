# GHS JLT Website
This project contains the source *code* for the JLT website Developed by HitikG and Ramit110.

It is currently being constructed and will be maintained by anyone who wishes to contribute.
For those wondering we are using a dummy database hosted on the HRiServer - 'The Crashed' - at the moment but we intend to use LocalDB in the final product.

For those who wish to contribute:
* Create a fork
* Add your own code
* Submit a pull request

And if we believe it is of acctual benefit to our project we will syncronise your fork with the main project else we will close it.

Feel free to make your own forks to the project and edit the code in such a way that it could fit your neeeds. All the required documentation is already in most of the files.
